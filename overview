Week 7
- Recap basic (Loop, method, class, object etc)
- Refactoring
- Primitive- and reference-type variables
    Java is a strongly typed language, what this means is that all of its variables have a type
        2 types : primitive-type and reference-type variables
    both have slot.
        Primitive-type variables hold the concrete value in their slot,
            int, double, char, boolean, short, float, byte and long
        reference-type variables hold a reference to a concrete object.
- Hashmap
    HashMap<key, value>
    HashMap<String, Book> map = new HashMap<String, Book>();
    methods
        get(key) return value
        containskey(key) return boolean
        values() Returns a set of values in the HashMap
        keySet() return set of keys
        size()
    HashMap keys and stored objects are reference-type variables
        int -> Integer, double -> Double, char -> Character
        Java encapsulates original-type values and translates them into reference-type in Hashmap
        auto-boxing = translation of original-type variables into reference-type ones
        make sure the value is not null when tranlating reference-type to original-type. Use containsKey method
